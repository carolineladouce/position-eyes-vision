The UI updates according to the position of the users eyes in relation to the rectangle drawn onscreen.
When the users eyes are completely located within the bounds of the rectangle, the rectangle outline turns blue.
When the users eyes move outside of the rectangle's bounds, the rectangle outline turns orange and signals the user to reposition their eyes within the rectangle.

 
This project uses Swift, SwiftUI with UIKit integration, Vision, and AVFoundation.
